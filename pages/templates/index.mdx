# Getting Started with Templates

Welcome to Percept UI! This guide will walk you through setting up and using the templates for popular frameworks with minimal configuration, allowing you to dive straight into building your product.

## Step 1: Install Percept UI CLI

To begin using the templates, first, you need to install the Percept UI CLI globally. This will allow you to easily create projects with your desired template.

### Install the CLI

```bash copy
npm install -g @perceptui/cli
```

## Step 2: Create a New Project Using a Template
Now that youâ€™ve installed the CLI, you can create a new project with a template that suits your needs. Percept UI provides templates for various popular frameworks, including React, Next.js, and more.

### Create a React Project with Tailwind CSS
```bash copy
npx percept-ui create react-tailwind my-project
```
This command will initialize a new React project with Percept UI components and Tailwind CSS pre-configured.

### Available Templates:
- React + Tailwind: Set up a React project with Tailwind CSS configured.
- Next.js + Tailwind: Start a Next.js project with Tailwind CSS pre-configured.

## Step 3: Start the Development Server
Once your project is created, navigate to the project folder and run the development server.

```bash copy
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the server. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your project in action.

## Step 4: Customize Your Template
You now have a fully configured template with customizable Percept UI components. You can start editing the components, update the UI, and focus on building your product.

### Example: Customizing the Button Component
To customize a button, navigate to src/components/Button.jsx and modify its styles and properties as needed.

```jsx copy
<Button variant="primary" size="large">
  Click Me!
</Button>
```
You can modify the properties like variant and size to fit your design.

## Step 5: Build and Deploy
Once youâ€™ve finished building your project, you can build it for production and deploy it to your preferred hosting platform.

To build the project, run:

```bash copy
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized build ready for deployment.

## Conclusion
Youâ€™re now ready to start building your project using Percept UIâ€™s templates! These templates are designed to save you time and help you focus on creating the product instead of setting up configurations.
